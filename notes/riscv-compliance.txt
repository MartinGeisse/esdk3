For the toolchain, the binaries must be in the search path and the compiler prefix is defined on the make line. The default value for this is

    RISCV_PREFIX ?= riscv64-unknown-elf-

The path to the RUN_TARGET is defined within the riscv-target Makefile.include.

To run the rv32i test suite on riscvOVPsim

    make RISCV_TARGET=riscvOVPsim RISCV_DEVICE=rv32i
