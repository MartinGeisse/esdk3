Implementation note: The classes in this package rely on the rule that a vector is always represented by the "most
appropriately sized vector class". That is, for example, a vector of size at most 64 is never represented by a
BigVector. This simplifies many operations, especially those that expect an "other operand" whose size is the same
as the first operand.
